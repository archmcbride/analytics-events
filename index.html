			<p>May the Father judge him justly. A forked purple lightning bolt, on black field speckled with four-pointed stars. House Tarly of Horn Hill May the Father judge him justly. More pigeon pie, please. Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. Words are like wind. The winds of Winter. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. Winter is coming. The North remembers. House Tarly of Horn Hill May the Father judge him justly. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. The bear and the maiden fair. A Lannister always pays his debts. Fire and blood. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. Pay the iron price. The night is dark and full of terrors. Winter is coming. A dream of Spring.</p>
